In this group project we managed to visualize & analyze an assigned dataset as a part of the final project of our “eye tracking module”. The dataset was provided in two formats; CSV & Matlab. We chose to work on using the CSV format. We used Google Colab, which uses python, to process the data. In the study, the dataset consists of raw gaze locations collected from subjects. The subjects were shown images and asked to indicate if they recognized the image or not. The subjects were seated 450mm away from the screen, from this position x and y coordinates of their gazes were recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The data of image recognition was also collected to the dataset, these were valued as TRUE if an image was recognized and FALSE if not.
Eye-tracking research involves studying the movements of a participant's eyes during a range of activities. It is important to know that there are many eye movements that can be studied, but we will focus on two important definitions before we start describing this project. Eye Fixations which can be defined as momentary pauses of eye gaze at a spatial location for a minimum amount of time (e.g., > 99 ms), and saccades which are the movements between successive fixations. Eye trackers are considered valuable tools reflecting perceptual and cognitive processing.  
There are three methods to detect eye tracking; Screen based, wearable, or webcam methods. The data for this project were driven from the Screen based.
